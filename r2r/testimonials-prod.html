It may not fulfill any prerequisites but I know that what I learned here will carry on throughout my academic career and life. I have an unbroken sense of optimism and pride and this class helped empower me to own these feelings and own my narrative to move on stronger than ever before.</p>

What I appreciate about this class is that it perfectly captured the common struggles that EOP students face everyday on campus and acknowledged them as real and gave me space to explore and be vulnerable about topics of failure, imposter syndrome, family issues, self-Iove/hate etc.</p>
