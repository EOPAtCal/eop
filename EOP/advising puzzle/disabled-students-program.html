	DSP currently serves more than 1,600 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at UC Berkeley. While many people assume that students with disabilities are mostly visibly physically disabled, at present the majority of students receiving our services have invisible disabilities. These students have learning or psychological disabilities and often do not traditionally identify as people with disabilities at all (although some do).  DSP helps students with disabilities navigate that system by establishing a set of academic accommodations based on each studentsâ€™ individual disability.
